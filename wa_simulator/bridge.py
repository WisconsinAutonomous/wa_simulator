    """Base class for a bridge interface between the simulator and an external entity

    There are many applications where it's desired that :code:`wa_simulator` communicates with external entities.
    For example, `Robot Operating System or ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_ is a popular tool for writing
    robotic control code. Simulation is a very valuable tool for testing, so being able to communicate
    with these external control stacks is an important feature.

    For each external entity that wants to be connected to, a new bridge object must be created. The :code:`multiprocessing.connection` library
    will be used and it's `Listener <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.connection.Listener>`_ class.
    The messages will be sent as dictionaries of data and messages to be sent at each timestep will be accumulated to be sent as one large message.

    Message types are dynamic in types, form and structure; however, there are a few rules that must be abided by. First, sender names must be unique. The
    name will be used as the message identifier in the dictionary. Second, the structure of the message types will be infered, if possible. Otherwise, they must be
    explicitely provided in the calling method when adding the sender.

    Args:
        system (WASystem): The system used to manage the simulation
        hostname (str): The hostname of the client entity
        port (int): The port to attach to
        use_ack (bool): Specify whether to use an acknowledgement when sending a message to ensure the client got the message. Defaults to False.
        is_synchronous(bool): Specify whether the sender and receivers are in synchronous mode. If yes, on each step, a message will be sent and received. If not, will not wait for a message to be received.
        ignore_unknown_messages (bool): If a message is received with an unknown name (not registered with :meth:`~add_receiver`), ignore it. Defaults to True. If False, will raise an error.
