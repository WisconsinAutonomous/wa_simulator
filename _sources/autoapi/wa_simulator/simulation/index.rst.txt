.. py:class:: WASimulation(system, environment, vehicle, visualization, controller, record_filename=None)

   Bases: :class:`abc.ABC`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. method:: Record(self, filename)

      Save simulation state. Only saves the vehicle simple state

      :param filename: file to append info to
      :type filename: str


   .. method:: Synchronize(self, time)

      Synchronize each simulation module.

      Will pass information between simulation modules

      :param time: the time to synchronize the simulation to
      :type time: double


   .. method:: Advance(self, step)

      Advance each simulation module.

      :param step: the step size to update each module by
      :type step: double


   .. method:: Run(self)

      Run the simulation

      Can be used to clear up main functions.


   .. method:: IsOk(self)

      Verifies the simulation is running as expected.

      Checks the visualization if it's still active. Should probably check other
      modules for any errors.

      :returns: Whether the simulation running as expected
      :rtype: bool
