.. py:class:: WAVehicleInputs(steering=0.0, throttle=0.0, braking=0.0)

   Object used to hold the inputs to the vehicle model

   The value ranges for the vehicle inputs may vary depending on the
   used vehicle model (i.e. radians vs percentages). This class is not reponsible for
   maintaining such properties, simply should be used for passing values around.

   :param steering: steering input. Defaults to 0.0.
   :type steering: double, optional
   :param throttle: throttle input. Defaults to 0.0.
   :type throttle: double, optional
   :param braking: braking input. Defaults to 0.0.
   :type braking: double, optional


.. py:class:: WAController(system)

   Bases: :class:`abc.ABC`

   Base class for a controller

   Controllers are responsible for outputing a steering, throttle and braking value.
   This is done because in real life, those are the inputs our cars will have. The
   derived controller's (i.e. the new class that inherits from this class)
   responsibility is to take inputs from the simulation and return these values
   through the GetInputs method.

   :param system: The system used to manage the simulation
   :type system: ChSystem

   .. attribute:: inputs
