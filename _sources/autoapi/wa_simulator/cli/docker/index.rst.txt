.. function:: run_start(args)

   The start command will spin up a Docker container that runs a python script with the desired image.

   The use case for the start command is when we'd like to run a :code:`wa_simulator` script with a certain
   operating system configuration or in a way that's distributable across computers. Everyone's setup is different,
   i.e. OS, development environment, packages installed. Using Docker, you can simply run :code:`wasim docker start ...`
   and run :code:`wa_simulator` agnostic from your local system.

   The start command requires one argument: a python script to run in the container.
   The python script is the actual file we'll run from within the
   container. After the python script, you may add arguments that will get passed to the script
   when it's run in the container.

   Optionally, you may provide a JSON configuration file. The JSON file defines various settings we'll
   use when spinning up the container. If a JSON configuration file is not provided, you must pass these options
   via the command line. There are many default values, so not all configurations are necessarily needed through
   the command line.

   JSON Settings:
       *   :code:`Container Name` (str, optional): Identifies the name that should be used for the container. If no name is passed, JSON will provide one. Defaults to "wasim-docker".

       * :code:`Image` (str, optional): The image the container will use. If the image has not been downloaded, it will be fetched at runtime. Defaults to "wiscauto/wa_simulator:latest".

       * :code:`Data` (list, optional): The folder that has all of the data files that will be used in the simulation. If you're familiar with docker, these will become `volumes <https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/>_`. By default, no volumes will be created if ``Data`` is left empty. Each entry in the ``Data`` list will be made a ``volumes`` and may have the following attributes:

           * ``Host Path`` (str, required): The path to the local folder that will be copied to the container. If ``Host Path Is Relative To JSON`` is not set to True (see below), it will be assumed as a global path

           * ``Host Path Is Relative To JSON`` (bool, optional): If set to True, the ``Host Path`` entry will be evaluated as if it were relative to the location of the JSON file provided. Defaults to False.

           * ``Container Path`` (str, optional): The path in the container to link the host path to. Defaults to ``/root/<file/folder name>``.

       * :code:`Port` (str, optional): The port to expose between the docker container and the host machine. This is the port that the server and client may communicate over. Ensure this is consistent with both your server and client code, as this will be the only port exposed. Default is 5555.

   Examples JSON files:

   .. highlight:: json
   .. code-block:: json

       {
           "Name": "Demo bridge",
           "Type": "Bridge",

           "Container Name": "wasim-docker",
           "Image": "wiscauto/wa_simulator:latest",
           "Data": [
               {
                   "Path": "../data",
                   "Path Is Relative To JSON": true
               }
           ],
           "Port": 5555
       }

   Example cli commands:

   .. highlight:: bash
   .. code-block:: bash

       # ---------
       # With JSON
       # ---------

       # Run from within wa_simulator/demos/bridge
       wasim docker start --json demo_bridge.json demo_bridge_server.py

       # With more verbosity
       wasim -vv docker start --json demo_bridge.json demo_bridge_server.py

       # With some script arguments
       wasim -vv docker start --json demo_bridge.json demo_bridge_server.py --step_size 2e-3

       # ------------
       # Without JSON
       # ------------

       # Run from within wa_simulator/demos/bridge
       # Running wa_simulator/demos/bridge/demo_bridge_server.py using command line arguments rather than json
       wasim docker start                 --name wasim-docker                 --image wiscauto/wa_simulator                 --data "../data:/root/data"                 --data "/usr/local:/usr/local \ # Each entry serves as a new volume
               --port "5555:5555"                 demo_bridge_server.py --step_size 2e-3

       # Same thing as above, but leverages defaults
       wasim -vv docker start demo_bridge_server.py --step_size 2e-3


.. function:: run_exec(args)

   Command that allows you to run a script within a running container.

   This command takes two arguments: a container name and a script. The container name is used
   to find a running container to run the script in. If a container is not found, a :class:`RuntimeError`
   will be thrown.

   Example cli commands:

   .. highlight:: bash
   .. code-block:: bash

       # The following examples can be run in wa_simulator/demos/bridge
       # To launch a container, you need to first run docker-compose up -d wasim-prod

       # Run the server
       wasim docker exec wasim-prod demo_bridge_server.py

       # With more verbosity
       wasim -vv docker exec wasim-prod demo_bridge_server.py

       # With some script arguments
       wasim -vv docker exec wasim-prod demo_bridge_server.py --step_size 2e-3


.. function:: init(subparser)

   Initializer method for the :code:`docker` entrypoint.

   The entrypoint serves as a mechanism for running containers with :code:`wa_simulator`. It may be
   desireable to have a containerized system for running :code:`wa_simulator`; for instance, if a script
   requiries a certain package, the Docker image could be shipped without needing to install the package
   on a system locally. The scalability of using Docker over installing packages on a system is much greater.

   To see specific commands that are available, run the following command:

   .. highlight:: bash
   .. code-block:: bash

       wasim docker -h

   Current subcommands:
       * :code:`start`: Spins up a container and runs a python script in the created container.

       * :code:`exec`: Runs a script in a running container.
